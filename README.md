AIDT has been invented to provide architects with the Automated intelligent tool. With AIDT, the Architect can design and modify the residential design projects in a real-time feedback loop. AIDT has created a bridge between physical and digital interfaces through Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning. Architects and clients can design through the physical interface and benefit from the 2D plan, 3D model, besides structure, function, and energy analytics tools in a digital interface. It makes them have better decision-making in a real-time feedback loop. Therefore, we currently expect that with the AIDT tool, the design process of Residential projects will be decreased from months to hours.

This repository presents how the machine is trained to generate a furnished plan. The author gathered 1200 Data through the AIDT tool, and by GAN(pix2pix), the model is trained to generate furnished plans. Data A represents color plans, and Data B represents furnished plans.
